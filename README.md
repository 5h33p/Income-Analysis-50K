# Income Analysis 💵
This project presents a machine learning model that is capable of predicting weather a person earns more than $50K per year.
The features used include but are not limited to: age, education, capital gain and hours worked per week.
The data used to train the model is from an [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income) and is also uploaded in the GitHub repository in case the source changes or is deleted.

## 📌 Key Steps

- Data Preprocessing
- EDA
- Model Training
- Performance Evaluation
- Comparison with Dummy Baseline
- Deploy

📊 Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask.

# 1 Introduction

The focus of this project is to create and deploy a machine learning model capable of forecasting weather a person earns more than $50K a year based on data about them. This README file is divided into the folowing sections:
- [Getting Data](#21-getting-data);
- Exploratory Analysis;
- Data Preprocessing;
- Feature Selection;
- Model Training and Test;
- Pipeline Creation;
- Result Evaluation;
- Model Deploy.

# 2 Body

## 2.1 Getting Data

One must create a dummy model to compare the efficiency of this model

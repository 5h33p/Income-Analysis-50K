# Income Analysis 💵
This project presents a machine learning model that is capable of predicting weather a person earns more than $50K per year.
The features used include but are not limited to: age, education, capital gain and hours worked per week.
The data used to train the model is from an [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income) and is also uploaded in the GitHub repository in case the source changes or is deleted.

This project is divided into the following parts:

One must create a dummy model to compare the efficiency of this model
